# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This collection houses all of the work I completed during the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course exactly as I submitted it. CS50 is a renowned and challenging course offered by Harvard University, designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the world of computer science.

## About CS50

The CS50's course was an awesome journey through the fundamentals of computer science and the art of programming. It covers a wide variety of topics, from the basics of algorithms and data structures to web development, databases, and more. It provides a deep understanding of the principles underlying computer systems and software development. This course also encourages all of us to develop a problem-solving mindset, crucial for our success in the field of computer science.

## What I Accomplished

In this repository, you'll find my completed work organized into the following folders:

- **Labs:** Exercises to reinforce concepts learned during the course.
- **Practice Problems:** Additional challenges to enhance my problem-solving abilities.
- **Problem Sets:** Weekly assignments that pushed my understanding of algorithms and programming.
- **Final Project:** The 'culmination of my efforts', a significant project showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course.

Each of these main folders is further organized by week to provide a structured view of my progression through the course.
