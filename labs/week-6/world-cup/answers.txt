Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The first prediction with only 10 simulations stated that Switzerland would win, that changed from 100 simulations onwards.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The predictions seemed to stabilise from 100000 simulations onwards. So I would say 100000 is good enough.
