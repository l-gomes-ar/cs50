First question:
By running the SQL statement; SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
I could get the following values:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
I would say they like to dance, are rather energetic and a bit neutral moodwise because of the number for average valence.
So, in this case, the aura would be a mixture of orange (high-energy), purple (danceability), and green (valence).

Second question:
It might not be very representative of the listener as I do not have a value for number of times the person listened to that song.
It might be the case where the listener only listened to the song a few times compared to other, more meaningful ones.
So even though this list comprises 100 most listened songs, it would be better to have the numbers for times listened each song, and have some sort of different
weight for the top 10 most listened songs or genre.
