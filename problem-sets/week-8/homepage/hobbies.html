                    <p>Welcome to my homepage. I’m an aspiring web developer. I love to explore different kinds of hobbies and learn new things. Here are some of the hobbies that I enjoy and what they mean to me.</p>
                    <p><b>Coding: </b>Coding is not only my dream and professional goal, but also my passion. I started coding 1 year ago and I am fascinated by how I can create anything I wanted with just a few lines of code. Coding helps me to express my creativity, solve problems, and challenge myself. I like to code in various languages and frameworks, such as Python, JavaScript, React, and Django. Some of the projects that I have created or contributed to are this website, the problem sets on CS50’s Introductory course, and some others on the introductory programming course at my university.</p>
                    <p><b>Reading: </b>Reading is another hobby that I enjoy very much. I love to read books of different genres and topics, such as fiction, non-fiction, history, science, and philosophy. Reading helps me to expand my knowledge, improve my vocabulary, and relax my mind. Some of the books that I have read recently and would recommend are ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’, ‘The Screwtape Letters’, and ‘The Wise Man’s Fear.‘</p>
                    <p><b>Music: </b>Music is a hobby that I picked up when I was a little kid, roughly 9 years old. I wanted to try something new and fun, and learning the violin seemed like a good idea. Music helps me experiment with different feelings and enjoy them. I also like to go to concerts, listen to music, and play together with friends.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time. They make me happy, fulfilled, and curious. I’m always looking for new hobbies to try or explore in the future. If you share any of these hobbies or have any suggestions for me, feel free to contact me or leave a comment. Thanks for visiting my homepage!</p>
